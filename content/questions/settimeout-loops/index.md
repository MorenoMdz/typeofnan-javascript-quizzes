Consider the loops bellow. What gets logged?

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(i);
  }, i * 1000);
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(i);
  }, i * 1000);
}
```

<!-- explanation -->

The setTimeout function will be called after the whole cycle is executed because of JavaScript event queue. Variables declared using var are global by default â€“ meaning i would be equal to 5 after the end of a cycle. Since all setTimeout functions are called after the cycle, the all would print 5.

Output of second loop even more bizarre. In ECMA 6 specification, the specified behavior is that in for(let i;;){} i gets a new binding for every iteration of the loop. Essentially each closure inside a loop gets a different instance of i.
